The serial ports (SPI or isoSPI) will enter the low power
IDLE state if there is no activity on Port A for a time of t IDLE .

The WAKEUP circuit monitors activity on pins 41 and 42.
If ISOMD = V â€“ , Port A is in SPI mode. Activity on the CSB
or SCK pin will wake up the SPI interface. If ISOMD = V REG ,
Port A is in isoSPI mode. Differential activity on IPA-IMB
wakes up the isoSPI interface. The LTC6804 will be ready
to communicate when the isoSPI state changes to READY
within t WAKE or t READY , depending on the Core state (see
Figure 1 and state descriptions for details.)

The software timer
can only be reset after a valid WRCFG

LTC clock mode???
